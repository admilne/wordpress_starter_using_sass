@import 'layout'; // Grids, responsive frameworks, wrappers etc
@import 'modules'; // Most code lives here. File will contain list of modules defined (and documented) one after another
@import 'other'; // Any code that doesn't fit in any of the other files. Code that couldn't be made modular
@import 'shame'; // All code you aren't proud of goes here with the intention of isolating it / fixing it later. File should be empty but sometimes you just have to throw a hack in there to get it working
